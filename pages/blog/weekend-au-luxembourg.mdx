Le Luxembourg est l'une des nombreuses régions méconnues d'Europe. En Belgique, elle est surtout connue parce que de nombreuses personnes y travaillent, mais nous avions entendu dire qu'elle offrait d'excellentes options en termes de courtes vacances. Nous nous sommes renseignés et avons découvert un large éventail d'activités à faire : randonner dans la nature, visiter les nombreux châteaux, apprécier les vieux et petits villages et même découvrir la capitale.

Dans cet article, nous allons nous concentrer sur notre séjour de deux jours et demi là-bas, composé de promenades dans le Mullerthal, de la visite du château et du village de Vianden, de la vieille ville d'Echternach et de la ville de Luxembourg. Nous y sommes allés à la fin du mois d'avril, ce qui était encore un peu froid et changeant, mais c'était génial pour les couleurs dans la nature et pour éviter la foule.

## Day 1: Vianden

We started our stay on a Saturday, driving about two hours from Brussels, taking advantage of the long weekend offered by the first of May off day to build a 3 days trip. Our first stop was at our "room" for the weekend. We tried different kind of insolite lodging, mainly in campings, because we wanted something easy and interesting financially. We were not lucky with most options already booked, but we eventually found <a href="https://kengert.lu/fr/locations/#quartier-huetten" target="_blank">a nice little hutte in Kengert camping</a> which was nicely geolocated.

We decided to go slow that day and only did the visit of Vianden. It's a small town in the northern part of the country's Ardennes region, crossed by the Our river, really close to the German border. <a href="https://castle-vianden.lu/gb/" target="_blank">The main attraction is its castle</a>, a beautiful large and old fortified Romanesque castle taking a majestic spot on top of the hill.

To be able to reach it, you can walk or take your time with the cute chairlift going over the river and taking you to the top for 5€. We recommend it, especially if you are missing the ski vibes or too tired in your legs to climb the uphill. Once on top, you have the chance to open your eyes on a great view of the village and its surroundings.

The main goal is of course the castle itself, which was renovated to welcome visitors. The entry fee is 10€ and gives you access to most of the castle, organised as a museum going through its history with pictures, models and paintings. The venue is also showing the remains of castle life from several centuries ago, with many preserved artefacts recreating authentic rooms and scenes.

After such a great visit we wanted to enjoy food in the town and after walking down the hill we found many interesting restaurants. We eventually picked <a href="https://www.hotelvictorhugo.lu/our-restaurant/" target="_blank">Victor Hugo, an atypical historical hotel-restaurant</a> with lovely old decoration serving French cuisine with touches of Luxembourg specialities. We enjoyed tasty seasonal asparagus alongside a yummy sole fish.

## Day 2: Mullerthal and Echternach

The second day was more sportive, with the goal of doing a small portion of the Mullerthal walk. The region with the same name, coined as the "petite Suisse of Luxembourg", offers a huge walking trail for nature lovers. We chose a <a href="https://www.mullerthal.lu/fr/fiche/walking/sentier-local-w7" target="_blank">short and interesting walk called the W7 trail</a>.

The walk started from the Touristcenter Heringer Millen where you will find the necessary parking spots and an impressive playground. It starts with a strong climb to reach the top and a wooden cabin to continue more casually through varied surroundings made of trees, rocks, water streams, cows, wooden bridges and more.

If it's your thing, note that there are spots for climbers in other parts of the Mullerthal, as well as longer walks and different views.

The 3 hours long walk ends with the most famous parts. First, two beautiful ponds, in the name of Kalktuffquell, with great colours connected via a small cascade. Second, a more impressive waterfall, called Schéissendëmpel, divided in three parts and crossed over by a cute stone bridge.

After a picnic at the end of the loop, we had the afternoon open for the visit of another town. We opted for Echternach, the oldest town of Luxembourg. It is rather small and colourful with catchy little terraces of cafés and restaurants. You can't miss the imposing abbey nor the old town area.

Picking a first terrace under the sun playing cards, we then chilled in the park, resting on some public hammocks with a view on the river. Once energised again, we went in the commercial street "rue de la Gare" and found a real great brewery with friendly owner (the Philo'Soff), where we enjoyed tasty beers and had our dinner.

## Day 3: Luxembourg city

Our last day was focused on the capital city of Luxembourg. We had read about a walk going through the nicest part of the city and did it. <a href="https://www.visitluxembourg.com/tour/wenzel-circular-walk-1000-years-of-history-in-180-minutes" target="_blank">The Wenzel walk</a> is amazing knowing you're in a capital as it goes via the Corniche (aka most beautiful balcony in Europe), the oldest quarters, the fortress and the Pétrusse park.

We ended up by chance at the place de la constitution, where there was an event with plenty of stalls serving food and drinks and selling local products. We continued with the upper part of the city centre with the Grand-ducal palace, its soldiers and the great places. It's amazing how the city works with 2 different levels: the upper part and the lower part (Grund).

We really had a great time overall in Luxembourg. Should we come back, we would probably spend more time in the Mullerthal region and would visit more castles and small villages. We think it is a great country to visit at any time of the year, and definitely one you should put in your list for short trips.

We hope you found all the useful info from us, and you got inspired and excited about this one!

Enjoy your next trip!
